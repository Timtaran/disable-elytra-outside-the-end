# Disable Elytra Outside The End

The mod does what it says in the name

Really simple mod I made for my SMP, but maybe someone will find it useful, so I published it

Since 1.1.0 you can *customize action bar warning message or disable it* via config (`config/deote.conf`). But because I'm trying to keep mod simple and version agnostic with multi-loader support (and I'm also inexperienced), **your server config changes will not apply to clients**

It is better to install the mod on the **server-side**, but you can also install it on the client to have better experience (be ready your elytras wouldn't open even on servers without this mod, currently)

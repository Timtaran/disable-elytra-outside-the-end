# Disable Elytra Outside The End

The mod does what it says in the name

## Features
- Use `/deote` command to modify config in-game (or GUI if playing with LAN)
- Change working dimensions via `dimensionList` parameter
- Change allowed flight items via `itemList` parameter (with Curios compat)
- Configurable messages when flight or firework boosting is prevented

- [ ] Spigot/Paper plugin (why not)

> I'm not planning to backport mod to <1.21.1, since networking got changed and I don't want to get into it.

It's not recommended to use v1.x, since it's buggy and terrible.
